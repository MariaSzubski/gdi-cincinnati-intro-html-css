        <h2>Poppyseed Roll Recipe</h2>
        <p class="group">
          The poppy seed roll is a pastry consisting of a roll of sweet yeast bread (a <em class="highlight" title="pastry">viennoiserie</em>) with a dense, rich, bittersweet filling of poppy seed. An alternative filling is a paste of minced walnuts, or minced chestnuts.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 packages dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup lukewarm milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp. sugar</li>
            <li>1 lb. margarine</li>
            <li>4.5 cups flour</li>
            <li>2 T. sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks, beaten</li>
            <li>Canned poppyseed filling</li>
            <li>Slightly sweet black coffee <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
              Dissolve yeast in lukewarm milk, with 1 t. sugar. Whisk to activate yeast. Should bubble up.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut margarine into flour, sugar, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add dissolved yeast and beaten egg yolks. Mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shape into ball, pat lightly with flour and wrap in wax paper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chill at least 4 hours.  Can be chilled up to 3 days. <em>(The longer it is chilled, the easier it is to roll out.)</em> Dough will rise.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375&deg;F.</li>
            <li>
              Divide dough into 5-6 equal pieces.  On floured service, roll a section to a ~1/4" thick rectangle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fill with nut filling below, or canned poppy seed, apricot, raspberry, prune, etc. Spread with filling, roll up tightly, pinch ends closed under the roll, and place on greased cookie sheet. Leave a little bit of space between the rolls to allow them to rise. Cover with towel and let rise until doubled.
            </li>
            <li>
              Brush tops will sweetened coffee.  Bake at 375&deg;F for approx. 45 minutes. Cover loosely with foil the last 20 minutes if rolls are browning too quickly. Rolls should be golden brown when done.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let rolls cool before trying to remove them. Wrap in foil to preserve. Can be frozen.
            </li>

            The poppy seed filling is a paste of <span class="ingredients">ground poppy seeds, milk, butter, sugar and/or honey,</span> often with additional flavorings such as <span class="ingredients">lemon zest and juice</span>. It may have raisins. The walnut filling is a paste of <span class="ingredients">ground walnuts, milk, butter, sugar, and raisins,</span> often with additional flavorings such as <span class="ingredients">coffee or orange zest</span>.

            A very long roll may be bent so that it fits on a baking sheet; the result is called a <em title="horseshoe">patkó</em> (Hungarian: horseshoe). Before baking, the roll may be given a wash of milk. The roll can be finished with an icing after baking, made of powdered sugar and lemon juice (or a glaze during baking). Usually it is brought from the kitchen already sliced.

          <p class="wrapper">
            In <strong class="highlight">Hungarian</strong> cuisine, the rolls, one with each filling, are served together. The combination is known as <em class="highlight" title="poppy seed and walnut">mákos és diós</em> (poppy seed and walnut). However, in some English language cookbooks there may be no mention of the walnut filling, as if poppy seed were the only filling used. Some other non-Hungarian food writers combine the poppy seeds and walnuts together in one filling. Because Polish and Czech culture have intermingled, immigrants to America sometimes use the term <em title="wheel">Kolache</em> to describe it.
